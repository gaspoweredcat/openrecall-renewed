# Take Control of Your Digital Memory

OpenRecall is a fully open-source, privacy-first alternative to proprietary solutions like Microsoft's Windows Recall or Limitless' Rewind.ai. With OpenRecall, you can easily access your digital history, enhancing your memory and productivity without compromising your privacy.

## What does it do?

OpenRecall captures your digital history through regularly taken snapshots, which are essentially screenshots. The text and images within these screenshots are analyzed and made searchable, allowing you to quickly find specific information by typing relevant keywords into OpenRecall. You can also manually scroll back through your history to revisit past activities.

## Why Choose OpenRecall?

OpenRecall offers several key advantages over closed-source alternatives:

- **Transparency**: OpenRecall is 100% open-source, allowing you to audit the source code for potential backdoors or privacy-invading features.
- **Cross-platform Support**: OpenRecall works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, giving you the freedom to use it on your preferred operating system.
- **Privacy-focused**: Your data is stored locally on your device, no internet connection or cloud is required. In addition, you have the option to encrypt the data on a removable disk for added security, read how in our [guide](docs/encryption.md) here. 
- **Hardware Compatibility**: OpenRecall is designed to work with a [wide range of hardware](docs/hardware.md), unlike proprietary solutions that may require specific certified devices.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher (Tested on 3.12)
- MacOSX/Windows/Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 verified)
- Git
- `xprintidle` (Linux only, for activity tracking): `sudo apt install xprintidle`

### Installation

We recommend installing in a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gaspoweredcat/openrecall-renewed.git
cd openrecall-renewed

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies and the package
pip install -e .
```

### Running OpenRecall

With the virtual environment activated:
```bash
python openrecall/app.py
```

Or using the direct path to the venv python:
```bash
venv/bin/python openrecall/app.py
```

Open your browser to:
[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) to access OpenRecall.

## Working Modules
- **App/UI**: Flask-based web interface for timeline and search.
- **Screenshot**: Automated background recording with multi-monitor support.
- **Database**: SQLite storage with semantic search vectors (`float32`).
- **OCR**: Powered by `doctr` for text extraction.
- **NLP**: Local embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.

## Arguments
`--storage-path` (default: user data path for your OS): allows you to specify the path where the screenshots and database should be stored. We recommend [creating an encrypted volume](docs/encryption.md) to store your data.

`--primary-monitor-only` (default: False): only record the primary monitor. If set to `False` (default), OpenRecall runs in multi-monitor mode, capturing all screens. Check strict constraints on database were removed to allow multiple screenshots per timestamp.

## Uninstall instructions

To uninstall OpenRecall and remove all stored data:

1. Remove the virtual environment and project folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf venv
   cd ..
   rm -rf openrecall-renewed
   ```

2. Remove stored data:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     rmdir /s %APPDATA%\openrecall
     ```
   - On macOS:
     ```
     rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/openrecall
     ```
   - On Linux:
     ```
     rm -rf ~/.local/share/openrecall
     ```

Note: If you specified a custom storage path at any time using the `--storage-path` argument, make sure to remove that directory too.
